# Streamlined Process

## 1. Rolling for the 6 main ability scores:

- Roll 4d6 and keep the sum of the highest 3.
- Repeat 5 times to get 6 numbers
- Distribute the 6 values to each ability score depending on your race/class/background
- Assign the modifiers according to the table (`p14`):
- HP = Max HD roll + CONm
- For new levels you can either roll HD + CONm and add to previous HP *or* take the mean value for your HD + CONm and add to previous HP.

## 2. Define your character’s basic info:

- Name
- Age
- Height and Weight can be picked from the table on `p121`.
- ~~Alignment~~
- Speed → Race Traits
- Languages → Race Traits + Languages Table (`p123`) if applicable
- Record the remaining race traits on the sheet

## 3. Class stats (Check Class Feats):

   1. HP setup → 10 \+ CON modifier \-\> Check Class feats for lvl3 info  
   2. Class proficiencies \-\> Check Class Feats for up to lvl3 info  
   3. Add the skills for up to lvl3 \-\> Check Class Feats  
   4. Cantrips and spells \-\> Check past Class Feats  
   5. Subclasses and variations \-\> Check Class Feats \-\> Set in last page  
   6. Remind the player to record their spell slots etc. The Cantrip and Spell list for each class is in p207.  
   7. Check if everything has been registered in the players sheet

## 4. Personality and Background:

   1. Choose and tweak the [background]([[Backgrounds]]) if needed (`p127`):
