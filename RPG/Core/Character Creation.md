# Streamlined Process

## 1. Rolling for the 6 main ability scores:

- Roll 4d6 and keep the sum of the highest 3.
- Repeat 5 times to get 6 numbers
- Distribute the 6 values to each ability score depending on your race/class/background
- Assign the modifiers according to the table (`p14`):
- HP = Max HD roll + CONm
- For new levels you can either roll HD + CONm and add to previous HP *or* take the mean value for your HD + CONm and add to previous HP.

## 2. Define your character’s basic info:

- Name
- Age
- ~~Alignment~~
- Speed → Race Traits
- Languages → Race Traits + Languages Table (`p123`) if applicable
- Record the remaining race traits on the sheet
