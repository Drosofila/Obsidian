* Three main DnD rolls:

## Ability Checks %% fold %%

* A tie means neither party gets what they want, or the situation remains the same.

## Skills: %% fold %% 

* Specific aspects tied to ability scores
- The bonus for proficiency in a skill is the ability modifier + the proficiency bonus by race / class
- Depending on the check, if it’s related to a skill, the DM or the player can specify that that check is to be made using that skill, and if the player is proficient with the skill the proficiency bonus applies. If the player is not proficient, the check is normal.
