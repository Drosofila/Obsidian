## Ability Checks %% fold %%

* The comparison is made between both rolls and not a set reference value  
* A tie means neither party gets what they want, or the situation remains the same.

## Skills: %% fold %% 

* Specific aspects tied to ability scores
- The bonus for proficiency in a skill is the ability modifier + the proficiency bonus by race / class
