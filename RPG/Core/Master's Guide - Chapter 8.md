# Abilities, Skills, Checks and Interactions %% fold %% 

## Saving Throws

- Instant response to a harmful effect
- Not done by choice
- Happens when the target has a chance to avoid that effect.
- The situation / spell tells what kind of saving throw is required and the DC for it.
- Exemples:
	- STR: Opposing a physical force.
	- DEX: Dodging.
	- CON: Enduring a harmful effect.
	- INT: Disbelieving illusions and resisting mental assaults
	- Resisting charm, frighten and assaults to your willpower.
	- CHA: Resisting possession

## Difficulty Class (DC)

- Established by the DM -  can even be changed after establishment.
- ==Typical DCs:==
	- ==Very Easy: 5==
	- ==Easy: 10==
	- ==Moderate: 15==
	- ==Hard: 20==
	- ==Very Hard: 25==
	- ==Nearly Impossible: 30==
- Consider the complexity of a task before asking for a check - easy and trivial tasks should normally be accomplished without having to go through a ability check.
- DC 25 is very hard for low level PCs and DC 30 is nearly impossible for low level PCs.
- Automatic successes → if the DC is (Ability Score) - 5 or less.

## Proficiency 

- Remind the players that they’re able to ask if a proficiency applies.
- Think of it as improvements gained from training and practice.

## Advantage and Disadvantage

- Reflect temporary circumstances.
- Can be a great way to reward a player for roleplaying well.
- Granting advantage:
	- Circumstances provide an edge.
	- Environmental aspects provide an edge
	- PC creativity.
	- Improvements related to precious actions.
- Imposing Disadvantage:
	- Circumstances hinder success.
	- Environment hinders success
	- Something in the PC’s description of the action hinders success.


## Inspiration

- Encourage roleplay and risk-taking.
- Allowing inspiration after the roll → a rewarding cushion against failure.


## Resolution and Consequence

- When an ability check equals or exceeds a DC, it succeeds.
- When a character fails by 1 or 2, consider allowing success with applicable complications.
- Degrees of failure: consider by how far the player has failed the check to adjust the consequences accordingly.
- Critical Success or Critical Failure:
	- Rolling 20 or 1 during ability checks or saving throws does not imply critical. However, depending on the situation, it can make things happen little better or a little worse.


## Exploration

- Map Travel Pace → [[Chapter 8 Reference Tables.canvas|Chapter 8 Reference Tables]]
- Visibility Outdoors: 2 miles in any direction on a clear day.
- DEX Stealth Checks are compared against WIS.
- Tracking is a WIS Survival check. Tracking DC → [[Chapter 8 Reference Tables.canvas|Chapter 8 Reference Tables]]

## Social Interaction

- Balance roleplay with chokepoints for skill checks where relevant consequences or difficult actions are involved.
- CHA

## Resolving Interaction

- CHA check might be required for situations that offer risk or consequences to a ==friendly== NPC.
- CHA check might be required for situation that offer risk or consequences or a situation where nothing is to be gained by an ==indifferent== NPC.
- CHA check is required to get almost any cooperation from a hostile NPC.

## Conversation

- Creature’s and NPC’s attitudes can change during interactions depending on PCs actions - try to roleplay each one accordingly.
- PC’s can attempt a WIS check to uncover one of the creature’s characteristics after striking conversation for a while.
- Requests and Demands call for CHA checks.
- Use the conversation reaction table for this → [[Chapter 8 Reference Tables.canvas|Chapter 8 Reference Tables]]
- Balance Advantages and Disadvantages based on roleplaying attempts of help from other PC’s characters.
- Particularly with CHA checks, multiple attempts at the same check can have very bad outcomes.


## Roleplaying

- Be the NPC.
- Show, don’t tell.


## Objects

- With enough time and the right tools, PCs usually can destroy almost any object - use your judgment of the situation to impose the limits if what they want to do is insane.
- Use the Object Armor Class Table → [[Chapter 8 Reference Tables.canvas|Chapter 8 Reference Tables]]
- Object HP: How much damage an object can take before it breaks.
- Object HP Table → [[Chapter 8 Reference Tables.canvas|Chapter 8 Reference Tables]]
- Normal Weapons are useless against huge and gargantuan objects - use your good judgement. Sometimes even if makes sense that the object can be slightly damaged by the players, think about how significant this damage would be and how long it would take to achieve their goal at this rate.
- Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage.
- Some objects have a damage threshold that requires an amount of damage to be dealt in a single hit for it to start taking damage.


# Combat %% fold %% 

## Tracking initiative

- Hidden List: keep the sequence hidden until it is naturally discovered by players.
- Visible List: display the sequence for all to see - removes any uncertainty about when the monster hit.
- ==Index Cards==: Each member participation in combat, PCs and monsters, get a index card. The initiative number is written in each card and the cards are arranged in order of play and after each turn the played card goes to the end of the stack.

## Tracking Monster HP

- Most DMs track damage in secret.
- Try to keep the total HP a secret and give the players hints as to how badly damage each monster is during their actions.

## Using and Tracking Conditions

- Track conditions in the same place you track HP.
- Don’t track conditions necessarily on the combat cards used for initiative since a monster or PC can be a target during another PC or monster’s turn and their card is buried behind all the other cards. - the ideal way would be to have the cards for initiative sequencing in a stack and a table for each character involved in combat with info tracking HP and status effects.
- Players should be responsible for tracking their own conditions but they often tend to be forgetful. Try to keep data about everyone involved in the combat and if there’s any discrepancy between your tracking and the player’s tracking you can discuss and come to an agreement.
- Handing condition cards to players is also an option when playing IRL.

## Monsters and critical hits

- Monsters and PCs follow the same rules for critical hits.
- Improvising Damage → [[ImprovisingDamage.webp]]
- Damage Severity and Level → [[DamageSeverityPerLevel.webp]]
- The target in area of effect table can be used if you’re not using miniatures or any other form of visual representation for the combat → [[TargetsInAreasOfEffect.webp]]

## Handling Mobs

- To keep combat moving in crowded battlefields you can replace attack rolls by an average attack number:
	- Determine the minimum d20 roll a creature needs in order to hit a target by subtracting it’s attack bonus from the targets ac (Target AC - AB).
	- Look up the minimum d20 roll on the Mob Attacks table [[MobAttacks.webp]]
	- The table shows how many enemies are need for 1 to hit the target.
	- If they deal different amounts of damage, use the highest one.
	- This system ignores critical hits.

## Using miniatures and tokens

- Whenever possible, It’s best to use some kind of visual representation to guide the players, even if it’s not to scale or methodically thought out.
- The most common type of map is the 5-foot grid, however grids are not required.
- You can use creature size (→ [[CreatureSizeAndSpace.webp]]) to represent visually the creature’s size.
- Flanking:
	- Only enemies that can be seen.
	-
