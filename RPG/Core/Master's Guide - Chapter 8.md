## Saving Throws

- Instant response to a harmful effect
- Not done by choice
- Happens when the target has a chance to avoid that effect.
- The situation / spell tells what kind of saving throw is required and the DC for it.
- Exemples:
	- STR: Opposing a physical force.
	- DEX: Dodging.
	- CON: Enduring a harmful effect.
	- INT: Disbelieving illusions and resisting mental assaults
	- Resisting charm, frighten and assaults to your willpower.
	- CHA: Resisting possession

## Difficulty Class (DC)

- Established by the DM -  can even be changed after establishment.
- Typical DCs:
	- Very Easy: 5
	- Easy: 10
	- Moderate: 15
	- Hard: 20
	- Very Hard: 25
	- Nearly Impossible: 30
- Consider the complexity of a task before asking for a check - easy and trivial tasks should normally be accomplished without having to go through a ability check.
- DC 25 is very hard for low level PCs and DC 30 is nearly impossible for low level PCs.
- Automatic successes → if the DC is (Ability Score) - 5 or less.

## Proficiency 

- Remind the players that they’re able to ask if a proficiency applies.
- Think of it as improvements gained from training and practice.

## Advantage and Disadvantage

- Reflect temporary circumstances.
- Can be a great way to reward a player for roleplaying well.
- Granting advantage:
	- Circumstances provide an edge.
	- Environmental aspects provide an edge
	- PC creativity.
	- Improvements related to precious actions.
- Imposing Disadvantage:
	- Circumstances hinder success.
	- Environment hinders success
	- Something in the PC’s description of the action hinders success.


## Inspiration

- Encourage roleplay and risk-taking.
- Allowing inspiration after the roll → a rewarding cushion against failure.


## Resolution and Consequence

- When an ability check equals or exceeds a DC, it succeeds.
- When a character fails by 1 or 2, consider allowing success with applicable complications.
- Degrees of failure: consider by how far the player has failed the check to adjust the consequences accordingly.
- Critical Success or Critical Failure:
	- Rolling 20 or 1 during ability checks or saving throws does not imply critical. However, depending on the situation, it can make things happen little better or a little worse.
