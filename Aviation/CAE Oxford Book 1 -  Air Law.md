### Chapter 13 - SSR and ACAS  

- Questions: ==100% 8/8==
- Secondary Surveillance Radar
    - Started being used in the Second World War to identify friend from foe. It had the codename parrot - from where the term “squawk” is derived.
    - Today’s Airborne SSR equipment is called a transponder (transmits a response).
    - Transponder operates using a 4 digit sequence, each from 0 to 7 - totalizing 4096 possible combinations (8^4).
    - Special codes: 7700 - Emergency, 7600 - Radio Failure, 7500 - Unlawful Interference.
    - Reserved Codes: 7000 - Conspicuity, 2000 - Absence of ATC direction or regional air navigation agreement, 0000 - Unserviceable transponder.
    - Altitude tolerance received from the transponder is +-300 ft.
- ACAS: Airborne Collision Avoidance System
    - Used to avoid potential collisions, increase situational awareness and help identify traffic.
    - TA: traffic advisory - Advises of a potential threat (that can become a RA). No need to maneuver the aircraft for a TA.
    - RA: Resolution Advisory - Need for immediate action by the pilot following the RA maneuver or whichever maneuver necessary to clear the conflict.
    - Always notify ATC.
### Chapter 14 - Airspace 

- Questions: ==83% - 31/37== - 3, 6, 10, 19, 23, 37
- FIR: Flight Information Region
    - The basic unit of airspace
    - Provides the most basic service for air traffic
- UIR: Upper Information Region
    - FIR for upper levels
- OCA: Oceanic Control Area
    - Airspace above FL55 over the ocean
    - Special rules apply
- CTA: Control Area
    - Provides Area control traffic service
    - Usually the linking region between airways towards an airport, outside of departure and approach procedures
- CTR: Control Zone
    - Provides ATC to departing and arriving traffic
    - Since it’s a zone, the lowest level is the ground
- Classes of airspace:

- Class E provides ATC only to IFR traffic
- RNP: Required Navigation Performance - a numerical representation of the required accuracy that the aircraft has to maintain for 95% while within the RNP airspace. The value is specified by the state.

### Chapter 16 - Separation 

- 82% - ==41/50== - 4, 5, 8, 17, 21, 27, 32, 34, 48
- Vertical Separation
    - Maximize the use of airspace vertically and minimize the use horizontally (optimization).
    - Minima:
        - RVSM: 1000 ft (300ft tolerance for each and 400 ft inner buffer).
        - Non-RVSM: 2000 ft.
    - Minimum cruising level: The level at or immediately above the minimum cruising altitude.
- Horizontal Separation:
    - Based on time or distance.
    - Lateral: determined by state authority to comply with navigational inaccuracies and with an added buffer.
    - Geographical: Determined visually or by reference to a NAVAID.
    - Track: Aircraft using the same NAVAID
        - VOR: 15 degrees divergence
        - NDB: 30 degree divergence
        - DR: 45 degree divergence
- Longitudinal Separation:
    - Time based:
        - Same level: 15 min, reduced to 10 if frequent position update is possible, reduced to 5 if same departure aerodrome or reporting point.
        - Crossing tracks: 15 min, reduced to 10 if frequent position updates can be maintained.
        - Reciprocal tracks is different levels: 10 minutes from the estimated passing point.
    - DME:
        - DME longitudinal separation: 20 NM, reduced to 10 NM if the leading aircraft can maintain 20 kt or faster.
        - 10 DME for climbing or descending and for reciprocal tracks.
    - Mach Number Technique:
        - A mach number is assigned by ATCO to an aircraft and has to be maintained. This assured the appropriated time and distance separation.
        - 10 minutes, can be reduced from 9 to 5 depending on the leading aircraft if it can maintain a greater mach number.
        - RNAV distance: 80 NM
        - RNP distance: 80 RNP 20 or 50 RNP 10
- Radar Separation:
    - Standard minima is 5 NM
    - Can be reduced to 3 if radar capabilities permit
    - Can be reduced to 2.5 if within 10 NM of landing ILS RWY
    - Can be reduced to 2 NM if Simultaneous Dependent Parallel Approaches are in use
- Wake Turbulence Separation:
    - Departures: 2 minutes
    - Landing: 3 minutes (2 minutes for medium behind heavy)
