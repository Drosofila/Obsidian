# Engine Start Procedure

- Cold Soaked below <font color="#ff0000">-40C</font>:
	- Don’t start or motor the engine.
	- Call maintenance for heating of the Hydro-Mechanical Unit.
- Below -35C:
	- Idle the engine for at least 2 minutes before change thrust lever position.
- Engine oil in cold weather:
	- Normal operating pressure may take several minutes to be reached.
	- Oil Pressure may go above the normal range and the OIL FILTER BYPASS light may illuminate.
	- Operate the engine at idle speed until oil pressure returns to the normal range (watch oil temperature rising).
	- If the oil temperature has stabilized within normal range but oil pressure remains above normal range, shutdown the engine.

# Engine Anti-Ice Operation

## On the ground

- Engine Anti-Ice (TEI) must be selected on immediately after both engines are started and remain on during ground operations when:
	- Icing conditions are expected or anticipated:
		- OAT is 10C or below AND;
		- Visible moisture is present OR;
		- RWY and Aprons are wet or contaminated.
	- Do not use engine anti-ice above 10C OAT.
- When TEI is needed:
	- ENGINE START Switches → CONT.
	- ENGINE ANTI-ICE Switches → ON.
	- Verify light transition.

## In flight

- Must be on whenever Icing conditions are encountered or anticipated.
- Not required during climb and cruise in temperatures below -40C SAT.
- Do not rely on visual cues.
- Start switches to CONT before engine TAI on.

# Wing Anti-Ice

## On the ground

- Use WAI in all ground operations when icing conditions are present or anticipated unless the airplane is or will be protected with the application of type II or type IV fluid.
- DO NOT use wing anti-ice as a substitute for ground de-icing/anti-icing.
- Do not use wing anti-icing when OAT is above 10C.
- When WAI is needed:
	- WING ANTI-ICE Switch → ON
	- Verify light transition.

## In Flight

- May be used and de-icer or anti-icer.
- Primarily used as de-icer.
	- Cleanest surface
	- Least possible runback ice formation
	- Least thrust and fuel penalty
- Anti-cer usage only during prolonged moderate icing conditions.
- 

# Before Taxi Procedure

- Generator 1 and 2: Normally the IDG’s stabilize within one minute, but due to cold oil up to five minutes can be needed for steady power.
- Consider delaying flight controls check until after ground de-icing/anti-icing is accomplished.
- Monitor flap position indicator during flap deployment and watch for unwanted flap stops - if it happens, the flap lever should be positioned in the same position as indicated.
- Ensure full flap travel from 0 to 40 before setting takeoff flaps.
- If the taxi route is anticipated to go through ice, contamination if precipitation is falling, consider taxiing with flaps up.
- Limit thrust during taxi.
- If engine anti-ice in required and the OAT is below 3C an engine runup is recommended:
	- 70% N1 for 30 seconds.
- Before De-icing/Anti-icing checklist:
	- APU ……………………. As Required
	- Flaps …………………... UP
	- Thrust Levers …………. Idle
	- Stabilizer trim …………. Set for TO
	- Engine anti ice………… As required
	- Engine bleeds ………… OFF
	- APU Bleed…………….. OFF
- After De-icing/Anti-icing  checklist
	- APU Bleed …………….. As Required (1 min)
	- Engine Bleeds ………… ON (1 min)
	- Flight Controls ………… Checked
	- Engine runup …………. As required
	- APU ……………………. As required
	- Engine anti-ice………… As required

# After Landing

- Flaps 15 if contaminated or icing conditions.
- Engine anti-ice on if in icing conditions.
