### CC8, CC11

- MEA: Minimum Enroute Altitude - the lowest published altitude between radio fixes that meets obstacle clearance requirements between those fixes (in many countries assures acceptable navigational signal coverage). Depicted as the plain numbers below the airway name. MEA applies to the entire segment, airway or route.
- MOCA: Minimum Obstruction Clearance Altitude - the lowest published altitude in effect between radio fixes on VOR airways, airway routes or route segments which meets obstacle clearance for the entire segment. In the US assures acceptable signal coverage only within 22 NM of a VOR.
- MCA: Minimum Crossing Altitude - the minimum altitude an aircraft must cross at certain fixes when proceeding to a higher MEA.
- MORA: Minimum Off-Route Altitude - Provides known minimum obstruction clearance altitude for 10 NM to each side of the route and a 10 NM radius around the fix identifier for the route. This is a Jeppesen derived altitude.
- Grid MORA: Grid (1dg x 1dg) Minimum Off-Route Altitude - Provides terrain and man-made structure clearance for the entire 1 dg latitude and longitude grid.
