## Receiving Flow

[[PC12 Receiving Flow]]

```ad-info
title: Flow Overview

- The goal of this flow is to check systems inital condition, run the initial preflight checks and energize the airplane for start.
- This flow begins at the LH Circuit Breaker Panel and ends after turining on the STBY Bus to get weather and clearance.

## Engine Start

```ad-abstract
title: Start Procedure


```

```ad-caution
title: Limitations

- Stable Engine Start: ITT Stable < 800C, NG > 50%, Oil temperature and pressure normal
- 10 seconds limit between moving lever to GND IDLE and ITT + NG rise
- Initial ITT below 150C

```

## After Start

[[PC12 After Start]]

```ad-summary
title: Flow Overview

- This flows comes after a good engine start, with parameters within minimums.
- This flows starts at the generators and ends when setting the flight instruments and navigation for takeoff
- The goal is to establish AC power from the generators to the plane, set up the ventilation systems and check the final systems required for takeoff

*AP Test: Press the test switch until you can hear the aural, then engage the AP and check if it can be overpowered by control inputs, then disengage AP.

** Pusher Test: Set PCL to 5-10PSI, press and hold the test switch, check CAWS Pusher Ice ON, check pusher and audio warning 3 times, interrupt the pusher with the yoke and then release the test switch. Check elevator movement.
