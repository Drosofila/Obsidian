# Limitations

## Airspeed

- Vne: 236 KIAS
- Vfe: 164 KIAS
- Stall Clean: 
- Stall Full Flap: 70 KIAS
- Vle: 156 KIAS
- Vlo: 156 KIAS
- Vmca: 76 KIAS

## Weight

- MTOW: 6500 lbs
- MLAW: 6500 lbs
- MZFW: 6200 lbs
- Maximum Useful Load: 2500 lbs
- Empty Basic Weight: 4000 lbs
## Fuel

- Maximum Fuel Capacity: 192 US Gal / **187.3** Usable.
- Maximum Fuel Load in lbs (for AVGAS 100LL): 1190 lbs.
- Approximate Fuel Flow @ **75%** PWR (**230 BHP**), 2400 RPM = 115 lbs/h per engine → **230 lbs/h** or **37 US Gal/h** total.

```ad-note

This would yield approximately a 5 hour autonomy **total** for a full tanks takeoff. 
Considering the minimum Dispatch as **Trip + 0.1Trip + 30 Min ALTN + 45 Min Res** cruising at **75% power** (fastest possible) would yield a **0320** autonomy and a **650 NM** range at **10000 ft**.

These are **very** conservative numbers.
```

- Approximate Fuel Flow @ **65%** PWR (**200 BHP**), 2400 RPM = 102 lbs/h per engine → **204 lbs/h** total.

```ad-note

This would yield approximately a 0545 autonomy **total** for a full tanks takeoff. 
Considering the minimum Dispatch as **Trip + 0.1Trip + 30 Min ALTN + 45 Min Res** cruising at **65% power** (fastest possible) would yield a **0406** autonomy and a ** 725 NM** range at **10000 ft**.

These are **very** conservative numbers.

## Normal Procedures Flows and Notes

### Engine Start

- Before Start Flow:
		Master + Alternators →
		→ Annunciator pane (ALT + PNEU Lights) →
		→ Gear down →
		→ Throttle Quadrant →
		→ Alternate Air →
		→ Oxygen →
		→ Overhead Switches.
- Starting Engines Flow:
		Throttle 1/2 in open →
		→ Propeller Full Forward →
		→ Mixture Rich →
		→ Magnetos ON → 
		→ EFP ON →
		→ Mixture Cutoff @ 6 GPH →
		→ Engage Starter →
		→ Mixture Rich when engine starts →
		→ Engine Instruments Check →
		→ Annunciator Panel Check → 
		→ Hydraulic System Check.

### After Start

- Flow:
		Avionics Master ON →
		→ Taxi and Nav Lights ON →
		→ Set Flight Instruments →
		→ Check All Fuel Selector Positions.
- Runup:
	- Maximum Mag Drop = 175 RPM

### Takeoff:

- TO PWR: 40 MAP @ 2575 RPM
- Rotation Speed = 83 KIAS
- Initial Climb = 89 KIAS up to 500 ft AGL
- Cruise Climb: 

- Short Field Rotation Speed: 76 KIAS
- Short Field Initial Climb Speed: 91 KIAS

### Climb: 


```ad-summary
title: Climb Flow (after crossing safe altitude of 1000 ft AGL)


→ Set CLB PWR (MAP, PROP, MIX)
→ Change Fuel Tanks (One at a time)
→ Turn EFP off
→ Turn Lights off


```


```ad-caution
title: Engine Limits During Climb

- Climb PWR: 35 MAP @ 2400 RPM (up to 38 MAP)
- Misture can be leaned to a minimum of 26 GPH FF
- EGT: 1550F
- CHT: 450F

```

### Cruise:

```ad-summary
title: Cruise Flow (after level off)

→ Lights Off
→ Fuel Tanks
→ Power
→ Cowl Flaps

```

```ad-warning
title: Limitations During Cruise

- Burn the outboard tanks first.
- Always check fuel pressure before and after changing tanks - minimum fuel pressure is 25 PSI
- CHT: 435F (400F for economy cruise)
- EGT: 1650G (Lean for 1525 if limited by maximum EGT)

```

### Descent

```ad-summary
title: Descent Flow

→ Lights on
→ Fuel tank selectors set to inboard
→ Start stage cooling power reduction + timing

```

```ad-question
title: Stage Cooling

Stage cooling is a method that helps prevent thermal shock and subsequent damage to the cylinder heads and other engine components. 
The basic concept is to reduce **2' MAP every 2 minutes** until you reach one of three windows:
- 18' MAP (from 30' MAP = 9 minutes)
- CHT < 300F
- 120 KIAS

Whenever one of these three windows is reached the engine is considered stage cooled and the pilot is free to change power settings freely.
It is advisable to add ~10 NM to your TOD planning to account for the stage cooling.

```

```ad-warning
title: Descent Limitations

- Enrich mixtures during descent and try to keep around 1350F EGT

```

### Landing

```ad-question
title: Visual Pattern

- Downwind leg: keep RWY under the fuel cap.
- Across RWY threshold: PWR 15' MAP + Flaps 1 + Gear Down
- Base: Flaps 2
- Final: Flaps Full

```


- Use 2400 RPM
- Approach Speed 100 KIAS

### After Landing

- Keep EFP on for temperatures above 24C.

### Shutdown

- Flow:
		All Overhead Electrical Switches OFF →
		→ Avionics Master OFF →
		→ Throttles IDLE RPM →
		→ Magnetos Grounding Check →
		→ Throttles 1000 RPM →
		→ Propellers Full Forward →
		→ Ammeter Check Below 25 amps →
		→ Cutoff left engine →
		→ Check Hydraulic Pump R →
		→ Cutoff right engine →
		→ Lights and Master OFF.
