# Volume I

## Chapter 1

- Lateral Performance: 
	- Oceanic, enroute and terminal phases: linear lateral performance requirements.
	- Approach phase: linear and angular performance requirements.
- Vertical performance:
	- There is no current RTCA/EUROCAE definition or standard for vertical RNP.
	- APV/Baro-VNAV do not constitute vertical RNP.
	- Vertical RNP is neither defined nor included in the PBN concept.
- PBN Concept: 
> 		Navigation Application - Navigation Specification - Navaid Infrastructure.
- (1.2.4.1) Specification is designated by RNP (X), where X is the value of the total system error in nautical miles, expected to be maintained 95% of the time.
- (1.2.4.3) Navigation accuracy is only one of the requirements. An aircraft approved for a RNP approach is not automatically approved for all RNAV approaches, and an aircraft approved for a X determination is not automatically approved for less stringent accuracy specifications.
- The main difference in definition for RNP and RNAV is that RNP implies the need for onboard monitoring and alerting navigation performance equipment while RNAV has no such requirements.

## Chapter 2

- (2.3.1) Oceanic and Remote:
	- RNAV 10, 4 and 2.
	- Rely primarily on GNSS.
	- Flight path is usually determined and created by flight crew and is not based on a fixed ATS route.
- (2.3.2) Continental en-route:
	- ICAO Regions use RNAV 5 for ATS routes and DCT.
	- US, Australia and Canada use RNP 2 for en-route continental routes.
- (2.3.3) Terminal Airspace: arrival and departures.
	- RNP and RNAV 1 are used in terminal airspace concepts with different forms of ATC surveillance.
- (2.3.4) Approach:
	- The concept covers all 5 segments of the approach.
	- Ranges from 1NM to 0.1 NM.
- (3.4.3) Operational Authorization:
	- Aircraft must be equipped with suitable avionics to allow RNP/RNAV operations under the specification determined and approved by the state authority.
	- Pilot training.
