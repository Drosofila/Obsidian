- A great circle is defined as a section of a sphere that contains the diameter of the sphere (Kern and Bland, 1948). Any section that do not contain the diameter are defined as small circles.
- In a sphere, the shortest path between any 2 points is going to be a segment of a great circle.
- A geodesic is a locally length minimizing curve, or in other words, the shortest arc between two point on a surface.
- The normal vector along any point of a geodesic arc lies along the normal to a surface at that point.
- On a plane, geodesics are straight lines.
- On a sphere, geodesics are great circles.
- That means that a great circle is a geodesic, but not all geodesics are great circles.
- There is a problem with the geodesic definition since on a sphere an great circle arc is only going to be the shortest path between two points if this arc is not greater than a semicircle.
